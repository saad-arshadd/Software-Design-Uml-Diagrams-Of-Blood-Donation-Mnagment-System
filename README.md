# Software-Design-Uml-Diagrams-Of-Blood-Donation-Mnagment-System
The Software Design and Analysis (SDA) course emphasizes the structured development of software systems using UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams, system models, and SQL for robust database management.

For the Blood Donation Management System project, the design incorporates a wide range of UML diagrams and models, ensuring a comprehensive and efficient system architecture:

Use Case Diagram: Identifies key system functionalities and interactions with actors such as donors, administrators, and hospitals.
Class Diagram: Details system classes, attributes, methods, and relationships, ensuring an object-oriented structure.
Sequence Diagram: Represents the sequence of operations between objects, such as the process from donor registration to blood allocation.
Activity Diagram: Illustrates the workflow of processes like donor screening, blood storage, and donation scheduling.
Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram: Designs the database schema, defining entities such as Donor, Blood Bank, Hospital, and their relationships.
Timing Diagram: Visualizes the timing constraints and interactions, such as blood collection timings and expiry management.
ECB (Entity-Control-Boundary) Diagram: Defines the architectural boundaries, showing how entities, controls, and interfaces interact within the system.
State Diagram: Depicts the states of critical entities like blood units (e.g., Available, Reserved, Expired) and transitions based on system actions.
Additionally, SQL scripts are developed to create and manage the database, including table creation, constraints, and CRUD operations. This structured approach ensures that every aspect of the system—from process flow to data management—is well-defined and efficient, aligning with the principles taught in the SDA course.
